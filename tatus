    MobC00200324 - When the phone is in deep sleep, connecting an accessory does not wakeup the phone
    [Defect]
    MobC00200324
    
    [Problem]
    When the phone is in deep sleep, connecting an accessory does not wakeup the
    phone. This happens when the accessory detection driver is tested in Non GPIO
    mode.
    
    While the driver is used in no gpio based detection mode the required LDO for
    mic bias to be ON should not be switched off. Do the following to enable it
    all the time
    echo 0 A2 11 > /sys/devices/platform/bcmpmu_core/regwrite
    
    Once the ISR is fired, until the work queue has finished its processing, the
    phone should not go to suspend, so use wakelocks to prevent this.
    Also, when the accessory is plugged in a button press on the accessory will
    wake up the phone.
    Again, when the accessor is plugged in, removing it will again wake up the
    phone.
    
    [Solution]
    Added wake locks to prevent the system from getting into suspend while we are
    still processing the wake up source interrupts. Since the driver uses delayed
    work queues, after the interrupts are fired, before the work queue is executed
    as well as during work queue execution (since there are msleep in work queues)
    the phone can go to suspend again. Acquiring a Suspend Wake lock would prevent
    this.

    [Testing]
        [Test Cases]
        On Rhea stone tested no GPIO accessory detection and we are able to do the
        following.
    
        Enable the regulator always as follows
        echo 0 A2 11 > /sys/devices/platform/bcmpmu_core/regwrite
    
        Run bcmtest -l and ensure that CP does not wake us up.
        at*mtest=1,1,"coolcard"
        at*mtest=4,0,511
        at*msetsim=1
        at+cfun=4
        at*msetsim=2
        at+cfun=4
    
        Press the Power on button (short press) to ensure that the system goes to
        deep sleep
    
        Connect the accessory and we can see that it gets detected.
        Wake up the phone manually and play any music and we are able to hear this
        on the HS.
        Vol +, Vol - button works OK too.
    
        Also, the use cases where the accessory is pluggedin allow the phone to go
        to deep sleep
        Now, press the button from the accessory and it  gets detected (all
        buttons)
        Now, again allow the system to go to deep slee, now remove the accesory
        and the removal works OK too
    
        Repeated the above test cases on Rheastone using GPIO accessory detection
        method as well.

    MobC00199749 -- Impulse noise at the beginning of audio recording with "Sound Recorder"
    
    [Solution]
    Need SW workaround to remove the inital HW glitch appearing at the VPU/DSP recordingi file.
    DSP interrupt interval for 8k PCM recording is every 80 msec.
    Add wait_cnt in VPU_Capture_Request callback to bypass first few frames.
    Make the wait threshold depending on rate.
    Do not wait frames if in voice call mode.

    Adding a macro to define the crash debugger's panic notifier handler priority.
    
    This is to make sure that notifier handler priority of crash debugger
    is always less than that of modem watchdog monitor.

    Monitor modem watchdog interrupt in AP
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00198140
    
    [Problem]
    Android AP needs to monitor modem's watchdog timer interrupt,because
    unresponded interrupt will lead to modem reset without restarting.
    
    [Solution]
    1) Request for the modem watchdog interrupt
    2) On receiving an interrupt,schedule a timer of 4sec.
    3) On 4sec timer expiry, check if an AP crash is triggered (AP
       has to be force crashed, at the event of a CP crash).
    4) If AP was not crashed (which means CP is restarted), force crash
       AP.

    AUDIO: MobC00198751 During MP3 playback the CAPH SRC mixer should run at 26MHz
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    <MobC00198751>
    
    [Problem]
    - <MobC00198751> During MP3 playback the CAPH SRC mixer should run at 26MHz
    
    [Solution]
    - When SRCMixer is running at 26M, 44k SRC does not coexist with other SRCs. Also run-time clock switch is not allowed. For playback on Android, it is feasible since Android only plays one stream at a time.
    - This 26MHz is not allowed during voice applications. Since 44kHz playback may occur when voice apps are active.
    - User space should still tell driver that 26MHz is prefered, once after bootup.

    [pmem] Fix unbalanced semaphore handling in pmem_lock_data_and_mm()
    
    I've gone through each path and removing the up_write() call should
    fix any potential problems with this, but the path is untested as the
    pmem_connect()->pmem_remap()->pmem_mmap() sequence
    never gets used in Android at the moment.
    
    This patch also makes sure we retain the owner(allocator) of the pmem
    data in data->pid (i.e. the one who is doing the bery first MASTERMAP),
    instead of overwriting it in every mmap

    [pmem] Remove pmem_dump()
    
    pmem_dump() was added in to show all the pmem allocations when the
    kernel is OOM. It did nothing when called in_interrupt(), but it didn't
    check for in_atomic() which it should have.
    
    We don't need this anymore, enabling CONFIG_SHOW_FREE_LISTS should
    suffice.

    PL330: Implement ERRATA 716336 fix based on PL330 revison ID
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
     Enhancement
    
    [Problem]
     1. PL330 driver assume r0p0 revision, by default implement memory barriers to fix errata 716336
     2. This driver will be in-efficient on other platforms(Capri) with pl330 rev > r0p0.
    
    [Solution]
     1. Add revision ID check for PL330 macrocell, by reading PERIPH_ID registers.
     2. Implement memory barriers only if pl330 revision is < r0p1 (i.e. r0p0 as on Rhea)
    
    [Reviewers]
     Joyjit Nath, Harvey Zien
    
    [Testing]
        [Test Cases]
    		- Revision ID verification on Rhea reads r0p0.
    		- Memory to memory DMA transfer
    		- SPI Loopback test

    AUDIO : add HW-CTL to control SRC Mixer clock configuration
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    Enhacement
    
    [Problem]
    To further save MIPS, SRC Mixer needs to consider setting of 26MHz clock
    
    [Solution]
    First stage to add amixer HW-CTL (AUDCTRL_HW_CFG_CLK) to caph_ctl.
    Add corresponding API in audio_controller and csl_caph_hwctrl.
    In csl_caph_ControlHWClock(), it will check the selection to set either 26M or 78M clock for SRCMixer.

    AUDIO : <MobC00198498> [Rheaberri ICS R1.1.14.1] BT HFP: Short static noise right after routing voice call audio from handset to car kit
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    <MobC00198498> Short static noise right after routing voice call audio from handset to car kit
    
    [Problem]
    The 40ms delay after sending DSPCMD_TYPE_AUDIO_CONNECT_DL causes the static noise.
    
    [Solution]
    Confirmed with DSP, as we have AP/DSP sync after COMMAND_AUDIO_ENABLE, the 40ms delay can be removed. However, for some reason, BT path does take more time than other audio path on HW setup, therefore move the 40ms delay up. Will investigate later on why we need extra delay on BT path.
    Move DSPCMD_TYPE_COMMAND_DIGITAL_SOUND before sending COMMAND_AUDIO_ENABLE upon request from DSP.

    BCMPMU-WD : behavior in some use cases should be corrected
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00195514
    
    [Problem]
    Watchdog driver supplied with bug 3596 has some deviations in control behavior from ones expected by driver users.
    We are expecting:
    - on closing /dev/watchdog unexpectedly driver should just allow watchdog to reset the device
    - on expected close() (after writing 'V') kernel should feed watchdog by itself
    - on reboot notification driver should feed watchdog and do nothing after it. Device should shutdown correctly during watchdog timeout.
    
    [Solution]
    Apply patch from customer.
    - Basic style fixes, redundant comments are removed, not very accurate
    - bcmpmu_wdog_keepalive() function is added
    - if /dev/watchdog is closed unexpectedly just give watchdog to reset device, do not force panic
    - Feed watchdog to give device a time to perform shutdown
    - Watchdog should be still fed by kernel if /dev/watchdog is closed expectedly ('V' is written before closing)

    crypto/spum: Fix incorrect DMA transfer from SHA accelerator when payload is a single sg node larger than 4KB
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00191418
    
    [Problem]
    Kernel crash seen when using Nokia security app (vinit)
    
    [Solution]
    The crash is a result of SPUM accelerator doing DMA to more than allocated memory for it. This code path
    gets executed only when a single SG node greater than 4KB is passed to SPUM driver from the caller.
    
    Fix is to DMA back to the source SG instead of to locally allocated DMA memory in driver.

    Always Load dummy sequencer at early init
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    
    [Problem]
    
    Dummy sequencer should always be loaded during early init
    (during pwrmgr init) and actual sequencer should be
    loaded after the pwrmgr is fully initialized
    
    [Solution]
    
    By default load the dummy sequencer during early init
    (rhea_pwr_mgr_init()) and then initialize the pwrmgr.
    Load the actual sequencer when i2c driver is initialized
    (bcmpmu_i2c_probe())

    USB: kmemleak and Coverity report memory leaks in DWC_OTG driver
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00196103
    
    [Problem]
    kmemleak and Coverity report memory leaks in ep_queue() function
    
    [Solution]
    The detected memory leaks are false positives. The DWC_OTG driver maintains a
    reference to allocated memory through physical address instead of virtual
    address in case of unaligned buffer, which makes kmemleak and Coverity think
    that no reference exists. Make sure that virtual address reference is
    maintained until end of transfer. Also, the buffer and DMA addresses passed

    [pmem] Fix lowmem re-mapping code to make sure we flush+invalidate cachelines
    
    The lowmem mappings needs to be changed whenever the pmem mmap() pgprot
    doesn't map pgprot_kerne (i.e. when userspace is trying to mmap() pmem
    device as uncached/writethrough). According to ARM TRM, from ARMv6+
    we need to make sure that a portion of physical memory is never
    mapped with difference memory-attributes/cachebility/shareability.
    
    So, we change the lowmem mappings to match the userspace request.
    However, we were NOT flushing the kernel mappings before we change then.
    That means, if there are dirty cache lines in the same region and they
    get evicted in the future, we will end up corrupting the memory allocated
    to userspace. DMA code clearly does that in __dma_clear_buffer() before
    it changes the kernel mappings.

    PM: Program CHIPREG PWRCTRL bits for dormant in B1
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00198613
    
    [Problem]
    Rhea B1 adds PWRCTL1_bypass & PWRCTL0_bypass in Periph Spare Control2
    register to store the CPU power mode. Boot ROM reads this register
    instead of SCU Power Status register to differentiate between POR and
    dormant reset. Linux needs to set this register to DORMANT_MODE before
    dormant entry.
    
    In the dormant entry path, if an event or interrupt becomes pending
    soon after the power manager starts the dormant state machine, the SCU
    power status bits gets changed from dormant to normal mode. This also
    gets latched in the power manager. But the system anyway enters dormant
    mode and on wakeup, boot ROM incorrectly senses POR instead of dormant
    wakeup. The new bits listed above is meant to overcome this problem.
    
    [Solution]
    Set CHIPREG PWRCTRL bits to dormant mode before dormant entry
    and reset it to NORMAL mode after dormant exit for Rhea B1

    AUDIO: MIN_PHASE register should be set for voice call.
    [Enhancement]
    <MobC00197921>
    
    [Problem]
    MIN_PHASE register is used to enable the minimum-phase filter on mic and speaker path. This is to reduce the time delay in UL/DL audio path during a voice call.
    
    Lindent causes a lot of warnings and errors on audio_controller.c and at_aud_ctl.c.
    
    [Solution]
    Add new csl_audioh APIs to enable/disable MIN_PHASE register bits for Mic and speaker path.
    csl_caph_hwctrl.c is also updated to check whether it is voice call and based on this information , to call the new APIs to clear or set the MIN_PHASE register bits.
    
    Clean up audio_controller.c and at_aud_ctl.c to remove the warnings and errors.

    MobC00188053: Need to replace delay() functions with sleep() where required
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00188053
    
    [Problem]
    The CPU usage is seen to be high even when most of the user processes are not
    busy. One of the causes attributed to this behavior is the use of delay()
    functions in the Kernel where in sleep() would be more appropriate since it
    would allow the CPU to go to idle oe run other tasks.
    
    [Solution]
    Replaced instances of *delay() function usage in the kernel drivers with the
    appropriate *sleep() function depending in the called context (atomic or
    non-atomic) and the delay period.

    Clock: Convert DIG_CH1_CLK to software gated
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00198407
    
    [Problem]
    DIG_CH1 clock is used by camera module. In Rheaberri
    and Rheastone,there is no external clock request from
    the camera modules. So if the clock is autogated, the
    camera module will not function. Hence change DI_CH1
    clock to software gated.

    1. Convert DIG_CH1 clock to software gated.
    2. Fix the names of DIG_CH[1,2,3] in clock lookup table.

    [Problem]
    The SPI driver expects TX & RX requests at the same time

    and vice versa.

    [unicam][BugFix] Check if buffer was initialized before releasing.
    
    Problem:
    
    Typical v4l2 userspace calling sequence for v4l2 looks like:
    reqbuf -> qbuf -> streamon ->  dqbuf -> streamoff -> close
    
    reqbuf allocates metabuffer(vb2_buffer) for X buffers,
    but for userspace ptr buf_init is not called its called from qbuf.
    Let's say if we failed to allocate first buffer, buf_cleanup will
    be called for all X buffers even though they are not initialized
    which results in kernel panic.
    
    The bug is in v4l2, buf_cleanup should only be called if buf_init
    is done. But this happens only for userspace pointers hence it's
    never reported in kernel mailing list before.
    
    Solution:
    This commit adds a check for if buf_init is called while doing
    buf_cleanup.

    Remove recursive use of spin_lock_irqsave() in pwr_mgr.c.
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    
    MobC00196261
    
    [Problem]
    
    Recursive use of spin_lock_irqsave() in pwr_mgr.c.
    pwr_mgr_sw_i2c_seq_start() function uses spin_lock_irqsave() and then it
    calls function pwr_mgr_clr_intr_status(), which again locks the same
    spinlock. This is a recursive usage of spin lock which can cause system
    lockup
    
    [Solution]
    
    Remove spin_lock_irqsave() from pwr_mgr_clr_int_status function as its
    not really needed (function does not need to protected because its just
    clears the interrupt status of power manager)

    RIL: need SIM lock support for user space RIL
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00192354
    
    [Problem]
    For security reasons, SIM lock needs to be handled in kernel; with RIL completely in user space now, there is no way for RIL to directly manage SIM lock
    
    [Solution]
    Add simple security driver in kernel for managing SIM lock
    - implement ioctl interface for user space RIL to use to get/set SIM lock settings
    - implement api that sysrpc module can use to retrieve current SIM lock settings in response to request from CP
    - port Athena crypto/sim lock helper functions

    AUDIO : improve audio_rpc response time from CAPI2
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    Improvement
    
    [Problem]
    The audio_rpc response time is heavely dependent on CAPI2.
    There are some TICKS_FOREVER API call may cause audio thread not returned.
    
    [Solution]
    Remove RPC_SyncCreateTID() call which may be a blocking call.
    Assign sequential tid value for each request.
    Also remove RPC_SyncWaitForResponse() to reduce wait for response time if any bad happening to RPC.
    Use callback HandleAudioEventrespCb() to check the corresponding tid request is acknowledged.
    Add print info for RPC request and response interaction.

    [cma] Remove cmastats and add stats at the end of per region debugfs entries
    
    - Disables CONFIG_CMA_STATS. it can be enabled at compile time through
    menuiconfig, but it will have performance penalty in cma alloc/free
    path
    
    - Enable CONFIG_CMA_DEBUG_FS by default for everyone. This creates
    2 entries right now /sys/kernel/debug/cma0-cma1
    cma0 - shows the "pmem" cma region
    cma1 - shows the default cma region
    These entries print out the bitmap in hex and also the total,peak
    allocations, total free and largest free block numbers at the end
    
    This change should also potentially fix the shot to shot
    time in camera take picture case.

    USB: Support USB shutdown before gadget registration
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    MobC00191069
    
    [Problem]
    Need to shutdown USB earlier than during gadget registration
    
    [Solution]
    USB is shutdown when gadget driver is registered but if that driver is installed dynamically then it would stay on until user installs the driver. Implemented changes to support shutting it down as soon as Synopsys driver probe completes

    AUDIO: HW loopback and voice record impact each other

    Defect
    
    [Problem]
    - After SW voice loopback, HW loopback does not work.
    - After HW loopback, SW voice loopback does not work.
    - Need to enable CAPH clock before any DSP command.
    
    [Solution]
    - The first issue is due to adc global bit is not set.
    - The second issue is most likely due to DSP status is messed up. CP function audio_control_BuildDSPUlCompfilterCoef() should be updated to handle the mode properly, it does not consider app currently. Before the CP update, go back to the old way.

    AUDIO: make sure Nokia only uses 3 audio App/Profiles.
    
    The only real code change is in this function, line # 747,
    
    void SaveAudioApp(AudioApp_t app)
    {
    	log(1, "%s currAudioApp=%d new app=%d", __func__,
    			currAudioApp, app);
    
    	if (AUDCTRL_InVoiceCall())
    		if (app > AUDIO_APP_VOICE_CALL_WB)
    			return;
    	if (app >= AUDIO_APP_MUSIC)
    		currAudioApp = AUDIO_APP_MUSIC;
    
    	return;
    
    	/*AUDIO_APP_VOIP and AUDIO_APP_RECORDING_GVS can only be set by
    	user space code. kernel audio code can not detect them. */
    	if (currAudioApp == AUDIO_APP_VOIP
    		|| currAudioApp == AUDIO_APP_VOIP_INCOMM
    		|| currAudioApp == AUDIO_APP_RECORDING_GVS)
    		return; /*keep user-set audio APP intact*/
    
    	currAudioApp = app;
    }
    
    The next commit will put in a skeleton to use policy functions.
    kernel code on Rhea can only reliably detect three APPrs: VOCE_CALL, VOCIE_CALL_WB and FM.
    VoIP could be mistaken by kernel code as MUSIC or RECORD.
    therefore we need user space to set App for all APPs except the three APPs detectable by kernel.

    [Problem]
    Sysclk_en behaviour found to be not very good even with jira2221 fix. sysclk_en stays high for unusualy long periods.
    
    [Solution]
    this could be because MM has left its dmesh unclean.
    fix:
    1. After MM enters retention or shutdown, disable MM memc port.
    2. do 16 reads from uncached buffer.
    3. enable back MM memc port.

    Rhea PWR Mgr : Modified PWRMGR HW semaphore lock/unlock function to use MM PI to request for TURBO mode
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    
    MobC00196887
    
    [Problem]
    
    PWRMGR HW semaphore lock/unlock function uses ARM core PI to request for TURBO mode. Since PI DFS API for ARM core expects lpj to be updated by the caller (as it'd done by cpufreq), we cannot use ARM core PI here. Use MM instead.
    
    [Solution]
    
    Updated PWRMGR HW semaphore lock/unlock function to use MM PI to push the system to TURBO mode

    mmc/sd stack - Don't suspend and resume the sd controller that is used for WiFi
    [Enhancement]
    When device goes to sleep at the Wi-Fi on state, it does not return resume
    state as SDIO Stack is turning off SDIO card power while it sleeps
    
    [Problem]
    The Linux MMC/SD stack does this by default. Note that for Rhea plarform
    Regulator ON/OFF is not integrated yet, so the said behaviour will not happen.
    But in future if we add the regulator code, then we'll start observing the
    said problem. So its better to prevent suspend/resume code flow for the SD
    controller instance used for WiFi
    
    [Solution]
    Use appropriate PM flags in platform probe function not to register PM
    notifier
    In the sdhci suspend/resume add protection to not do actual suspend/resume for
    SDIO devices (WiFi)

    Recovery: Add support for factory reset/recovery feature
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    New Feature
    [Problem]
    
    [Solution]
    Implement recovery feature on Rhea.
    As part of this implementation,
    - Added a partition add/remove notifier for mmc devices.This
      helps us track and received notifications whenevr a new
      partition is added/removed.Also gets the partition information
    - Reboot handler for writing Bootloader Control Block to /misc.
      Android recovery reads this partition to check for recovery
      command.
    
    on receiving a *recovery* command during reboot, necessary
    commands are written to BCB in /misc partition so that
    boot-loader can read the same and launch recovery.
    
    [Reviewers]

    	as "factory reset" option from UI.

    Kept the free list print in show_free_areas() which can be disabled
    at compile time using CONFIG_SHOW_FREE_LISTS
    
    Test : RNDIS ftp file transfer of 600MB file in LMP and Android
    For LMP :
    After the GFP_ATOMIC allocation starts failing the throuput goes
    as low as 1200KB/s (approx). Also, the allocation starts failing after
    250+ MB of transfer is done.
    
    For Android:
    GFP_ATOMIC allocations starts failing much quicker (After tranferring
    60MB+ file as expected). Also the throughput goes as low as 350KB/s (approx)
    The time taken to complete file transfer in this case is ~30 mins, but it
    does succeed

    [Problem]
    Some app values setting using at*maudmode=15,app,mode is inconsistent in readback.
    
    [Solution]
    This is due to the change in SaveAudioApp() to add the perserve of certain APP.
    Somehow PCG needs to call new API SetUserAudioApp() for setting the new APP.
    Change at*maudmode=15 to call new API.

    AUDIO: move logic from vdriver to controller.
    
    [Defect / Enhancement / New Feature]
    <Please substitute this line with one/more CQ IDs, e.g. MobC000xxxxx, MobC000yyyyy>
    
    [Problem]
    
    [Solution]
    
    Deleted some functions from audio_vdriver.h,
    Moved some functions from audio_vdriver.h to audio_controller.h
    
    moved variables from vdriver.c to controller.c:
    
    static Boolean bInVoiceCall = FALSE;
    static Boolean bmuteVoiceCall = FALSE;
    static Boolean bDuringTelephonySwitchMicSpkr = FALSE;
    
    static unsigned int voiceCallSampleRate;
    static Boolean IsBTM_WB = FALSE;
    
    In controller.c:
    
    Added static functions:
    
    static int isDigiMic(AUDIO_SOURCE_Enum_t source);
    static int needDualMic(AudioMode_t mode, AudioApp_t app);
    
    static void setExternAudioGain(AudioMode_t mode, AudioApp_t app);
    
    Simplified function
    void SetAudioMode(AudioMode_t mode, AudioApp_t app)
    *	this function loads audio parameters to HW and DSP,
    *	this function does not switch HW device.
    
    In at_aud_ctl.c, at line #217, separate functions for voice call audio tuning and music audio tuning.

        [Test Cases]
    voice call- NB, WB
    run script audio_all_test
    run script audio_call_test
    
    The voip test in audio_all_test does not work. Need to test VOIP this way and it has audio:
    1. Loopback, mic mute, device switch test
            vplay -C | aplay -t raw -c 1 -r 8000 -f S16_LE &
            amixer cset name=AT-AUD,index=1 2 //debug info
            amixer cset name=VC-SWT 1  //enable
            amixer cset name=VC-SEL 1  //set device to headset
            amixer cset name=VC-SEL 4  //set device to IHF
            amixer cset name=VC-MUT 1  //mute
            amixer cset name=VC-MUT 0  //unmute
    
    all test passed except one failure:
      mix 8KHz mono to voice call.
    the expectation is mixing, but actual result is overwrite.

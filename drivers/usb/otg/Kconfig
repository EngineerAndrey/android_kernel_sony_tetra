config USB_GPIO_VBUS
	tristate "GPIO based peripheral-only VBUS sensing 'transceiver'"
	depends on GENERIC_GPIO
	select USB_OTG_UTILS
	help
	  Provides simple GPIO VBUS sensing for controllers with an
	  internal transceiver via the otg_transceiver interface, and
	  optionally control of a D+ pullup GPIO as well as a VBUS
	  current limit regulator.

config ISP1301_OMAP
	tristate "Philips ISP1301 with OMAP OTG"
	depends on I2C && ARCH_OMAP_OTG
	select USB_OTG_UTILS
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips ISP1301
	  USB-On-The-Go transceiver working with the OMAP OTG controller.
	  The ISP1301 is a full speed USB  transceiver which is used in
	  products including H2, H3, and H4 development boards for Texas
	  Instruments OMAP processors.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called isp1301_omap.

config USB_ULPI
	bool "Generic ULPI Transceiver Driver"
	depends on ARM
	select USB_OTG_UTILS
	help
	  Enable this to support ULPI connected USB OTG transceivers which
	  are likely found on embedded boards.

	  The only chip currently supported is NXP's ISP1504

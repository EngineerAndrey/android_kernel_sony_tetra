 * A pointer to the following structure needs to be stored in the platform_device's
 * dev.platform_data member.
 *
 * The instance name and parameters are passed to vceb_get_or_create_instance.
 *
 *  The instance_name can be NULL or the empty string. In this situation, the proc entries
 *  will be created as before
 *
 *      /proc/vceb_init
 *      /proc/vceb_download
 *      /proc/vceb_xxx (etc.)
 *
 *  If an instance name is provided, then the proc entries will be created as:
 *
 *      /proc/vceb/instance-name/vceb_init
 *      /proc/vceb/instance-name/vceb_download
 *      /proc/vceb/instance-name/vceb_xxx (etc.)
 *
 *  videocore_param is a character string which will be passed on the command line to the
 *  the final videocore image. This can be used for configuring platform specific gpios
 *  lcd type, camera type, etc.
 *
 *  host_param is an opaque structure which is passed into the
 *  vceb_host_interface_create_instance function. It would contain information specific
 *  to that driver (i.e. gpio number of run pin).

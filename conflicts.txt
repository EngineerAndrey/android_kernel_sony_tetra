If you need to compare the BASE, LOCAL (map_integration), REMOTE (mps-lmp) and merged results, do the following:

> git checkout map_integration (1d5bc59035b967f)
> git checkout -b merge_branch    # create temp branch
> git merge mps-lmp (23decd11cca511)

Then you can use the git mergetool to compare BASE, LOCAL, REMOTE, merged versions of the conflict files. Make sure your actual conflict resolution is done in the mps_staging branch instead of the merge_branch.

Remove this file when all conflicts are resolved.
